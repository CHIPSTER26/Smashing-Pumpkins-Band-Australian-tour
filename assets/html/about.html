            <p>The Smashing Pumpkins is an American alternative rock band that was formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1988. The band's founding members were Billy Corgan (vocals, guitar), James Iha (guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums).
                The band quickly gained popularity with their first studio album "Gish" in 1991, which featured a unique blend of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and dream pop elements. The album was critically acclaimed and helped establish the Smashing Pumpkins as a prominent force in the alternative rock scene.
                In 1993, the Smashing Pumpkins released their second album, "Siamese Dream," which was a massive commercial success and featured hit songs such as "Today" and "Cherub Rock." The album solidified the band's place as one of the most popular alternative rock acts of the 1990s.
                In 1995, the band released their most commercially successful album, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness," which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 charts. The album spawned several hit singles, including "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" and "1979."
                Despite their success, the band experienced internal tension and conflict, which eventually led to the departure of Wretzky and Iha in 1999. Corgan continued to lead the Smashing Pumpkins with new members and released several more albums, including "Adore" in 1998, "Machina/The Machines of God" in 2000, and "Zeitgeist" in 2007.
                After a hiatus in the mid-2000s, the Smashing Pumpkins reunited in 2006 and released the album "Zeitgeist." Since then, the band has continued to tour and release new music, with their latest album "Cyr" released in 2020.
